## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This coding was the most challenging until now, I thought I would do it very quickly and easy, but that was not what heppened. First I tried to use css grid but it was a bit confusing, so I did some research and changed a few things and it worked, maybe not in the right way but I'm open to feedbacks so I can learn how it's the best way.

After that, I had my first experience working with icons directly in the code. I was used to work with them in images. This was very confusing to me because I didn't know how to change it properties like changing the color and stuff. I did some researches and I manage to do a bit like i wanted, but it didn't look so nice. So I'll need help to understand how do I put a border in the icon without looking oval and without making another area just separating them.

### Continued development

After this challenge I'll study more about css grid and practice more my HTML and CSS skills focusing on the responsivity, but I'll move on and start studying JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [How to use FontAwesome](https://digitalinnovation.one/artigos/como-usar-font-awesome) - I used this link to learn how to use the FontAwesome Library.

## Acknowledgments

In advance I would like to thank people who gives the feedbacks in FrontEnd Mentor because that is really helpful, mainly for people like me who study all by themselves.
